📌 You are an expert Salesforce developer and a specialist in mutation testing on Apex. You will be given an Apex trigger and its corresponding test class.

📌 Your objective is to analyze the code, identify error-prone areas, and generate **destructive mutations** (intentional changes that should make the test fail if it's effective).

📌 Here is the trigger to mutate: 👇

🔷 Apex Trigger or Class:
```apex
===APEX_CLASS===
```
End Apex

🔷 Test Class:
```apex
===TEST_CLASS===
```
End Test

---

🎯 Objective:

Your mission is to generate up to **5 destructive mutations** that modify only the Apex trigger or class section. These mutations must:

- Be syntactically valid in Apex.
- Reflect common or business logic-relevant mistakes.
- Cause at least one test method in the test class to fail.
- Be useful for evaluating the robustness of the tests.

---

✅ Rules and considerations:

1. **Do not alter the test class. Only analyze the `Apex Class` section.**
2. If you cannot generate 5 valid mutations, generate only the necessary ones (minimum 1).
3. Mutations should be varied: operators, values, conditions, returns, etc.
4. Do not repeat mutations or suggest changes already present in the code.
5. **Start line numbering from the keyword `trigger` or `public class`, which counts as line 1.** The total number of lines will be indicated by `===TOTAL_LINES===`.
6. Any part of the code can be mutated, including inner conditions, loops, `if` structures, etc.
7. Mutations must adhere to Apex data types, syntax, and structures.
8. The format must be **STRICTLY** as shown below.

---

📦 STRICT format per mutation:

```yaml
### 💥 Mutation [number]:

📝 Description: [verb + what is changed + why it affects the logic]

📍 Affected line: [line number relative to the Apex block. Total lines: ===TOTAL_LINES===]

🧠 Mutation type: [operator change, value change, condition change, return change, etc.]

💥 Expected impact: [names of test methods that should fail with a brief explanation]

🔁 Mutated line:
[the new line with the mutation applied]

🔁 Original line:
[the original line that was replaced]
```

🛡️ Apex Best Practices Evaluation

At the end of the analysis, evaluate whether the Apex code section complies with the following Salesforce recommended best practices:

```yaml
### 🧠 Best Practices Evaluation:

- [ ] Uses Handler pattern (no logic directly in the trigger)
- [ ] Uses Return Early (avoids unnecessary nesting)
- [ ] Avoids hardcoded values (uses Metadata or Custom Labels)
- [ ] Avoids DML or SOQL inside loops
- [ ] Properly bulkified code
- [ ] Explicit and clear exception handling
- [ ] Uses logs for traceability
- [ ] Separation between declarative and programmatic logic
- [ ] Test coverage greater than 75%
```

---

🚫 Common mistakes to avoid:

- ❌ Incorrectly numbered affected line (must start from `trigger` or `public class` as line 1).
- ❌ Mutating the test class.
- ❌ Trivial mutations that do not alter logic.
- ❌ Invalid syntax changes.
- ❌ Redundant or already applied mutations.
